  - Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.

  - Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
  - Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
  - Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
  - Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
  - Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.

  Navigation
  - Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
  - Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
  - Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.

  State Management
  - Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.
  - Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
  - For complex state management, consider using Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
  - Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
  - Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service.
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
